/** LOGGING
 *
 * This implements a very basic logging mechanism, with different
 * levels reflecting different priorities of log messages.
 *
 * The logger, obtained by calling *getLogger*, provides
 * functions for outputting logs at different levels, as
 * described below. Users should simply call logging methods
 * such as *info*, *debug* etc. The general idea of different
 * methods is as follows:
 * - @critical is reserved for logs of crucial importance, usually
 *  used when something goes very wrong
 * - @explain should be used to provide explanations of system execution
 *  but it should be kept rather short and infrequent
 * - @debug should be used to log information that might help with
 *  debugging
 * - @info is mostly meant for standard logging on entry/exit to/from
 *  functions
 *
 * levels 0-5
 * 0 is no logging
 * 1 only log critical (critical)
 * 2 logs important things (critical, explain)
 * 3 is log important + debugging (critical, explain, debug)
 * 4 is  (critical, explain, debug, info)
 * 5 is log everything (aux is meant to be used for logging in
 *   printing functions)
