/**
 * Bravery game
 * This is a simple one shot, two-player scenario in which only
 * player 1 is active. They have two actions to choose from: 'bold' and
 * 'timid'. The idea is that apart from their internal preference
 * for being timid, they are also being motivated by pleasing
 * their friends, modeled as player 2. To please their friends, player
 * 1 must estimate what they expect him/her to do and if they expect
 * bold, she/he's better of being bold, otherwise timid.
 *
 * On the other hand, friends (player 2) prefer their friend being
 * bold and moreover, they prefer to *think* of him as bold.
 *
 * This scenario is modeled using psychological games formalism and
 * three equilibria are found:
 * - bold
 * - timid
 * - 1/2 -> bold, 1/2 -> timid
 * Since beliefs are assumed accurate in equilibrium, strategy of
 * player 1 determines beliefs in equilibrium.
 *
 * We propose to model this scenario as a CSMG and offer insights
 * complementary to analysis via psychological games.
 * Our primary observation is that equilibrium behaviour may be
 * reached after repeated play, but is unlikely to arise from the
 * onset. Therefore, our model can be used to explain what happens
 * when those beliefs are inaccurate and when/if equilibrium is
 * reached.
 *
 * We model this scenario as follows:
 * Boldness of an agent will be modeled using goal coefficients.
 * In particular, there's one reward structure that assigns a unit
 * reward for being bold and another one that assigns a unit reward
 * for being timid. Adjusting goal coefficients corresponding to those
 * rewards makes an agent more bold or more timid.
 *
 * Additionally, we have a single mental reward structure that models
 * pride experienced by friends (player 2) following player 1's
 * decision. This pride is computed based on belief, detailed in
 * method *computePride* below. Now, player 1's motivation is dependent
 * on their second order belief, which is unsupported by our framework.
 * Instead, we assume that player 1 estimates pride of his/her friends
 * and gains their utility from that estimation.
